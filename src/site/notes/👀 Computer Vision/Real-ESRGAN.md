## Working with ESRGAN

<iframe title="Upscale your Images using DEEP SUPER RESOLUTION with ESRGAN" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67hqsP7fhvQ?feature=oembed" height="113" width="200" allowfullscreen="" allow="fullscreen" style="aspect-ratio: 1.76991 / 1; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe>

## Notes

> [!tip] Works exceptionally well!

Although I have not tried tweaking all the settings. But the default settings were enough to **impress me**!

> [!info] Highly recommend using Colab to try this. Without GPU a single image took about 20mins!
