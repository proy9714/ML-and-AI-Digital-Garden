## What is Torchvision Anyway?

Torchvision is a library in the [[ðŸ§° Tools/PyTorch\|PyTorch]] ecosystem that helps with [[ðŸ¤– Deep Learning/Computer Vision\|computer vision]] tasks. It provides pre-built functions and tools to load, preprocess, and transform image and video data for deep learning models. Torchvision simplifies the process of working with images by offering utilities for tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. It also includes popular datasets and pretrained models that can be easily used for training and evaluation. In a nutshell, Torchvision makes it easier for developers and researchers to work with visual data in [[ðŸ§° Tools/PyTorch\|PyTorch]].
